# question 1
# I am building some very high quality chairs and need exactly four nails for each chair.
# I've written a program to calculate how many nails I need to buy to build these chairs.
chairs = 15
nails = 4
total_nails = chairs * nails
message = "I need to buy {} nails".format(total_nails)
print(message)
# fix:
# chairs = 15 not "15"
# print (message), because we stated in the previous line what it means

# question 2
my_name = "Penelope"
my_age = 29
message = "My name is {} and I am {} years old".format(my_name, my_age)
print(message)
# fix: add " to Penelope

# question 3

total_eggs = boxes_of_eggs * eggs_in_box
